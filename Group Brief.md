#**Outcomes**

- Process music signals using signal processing techniques to extract its signal characteristics such as rhythm (e.g. beat), spectral contents (e.g. colour) and mood (e.g. swinging, loud, quiet);
- Creatively map the music characteristics to dance routines;
- Analyse music signals in real-time on the microcontroller to synchronize dance movement to music;
- Balance a mini-Segway using a PID controller so that it moves around on two wheels under the control of your phone;
- Implement the mini-Segway that autonomously dance to live music.

#**Assessment**

- **Presentation** by each project team to an assessor in the morning of Wednesday 20 March 2019
- Take part in a **"Coming Dance" competition** and showcase each team&#39;s design

#**Milestones**

1. **Control of the Segway – 20 Feb - COMPLETED**
  1. Drive the Segway with a stabilizer along a defined path using a Bluetooth controller
  2. Use stabilizer and later implement self-balancing

1. **Detects beats and flash LEDs – 27 Feb - COMPLETED**
  1. Analyse the music using the microphone on the PyBench and detect when the beat occurs – Flash LEDs to indicate beats

1. **Simple dance with stabilizer – 6 March**
  1. Analyse Staying Alive and Lose Yourself to Dance
  2. Create simple dance routines
  3. Transfer to the PyBench to store on the SD card and write a Python program to control the Segway with stabilizer so that it moves to music

1. **Come Dancing Competition**
  1. Demonstrate the Segway dancing to live music while balancing on two-wheels
  2. Assessment is based on robustness
  3. Creativity of dance routine
  4. Quality of synchronization to music
